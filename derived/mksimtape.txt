mksimtape
---------

This program generates a SIMH-compatible tape image file, from one or
more input files. It should be easily compiled using any reasonable C
compiler, for example:

  cc -o mksimtape mksimtape.c

Once compiled, it is run by giving it the names of the files to be
written to the image, in the same order that they should be written. The
tape image is written to standard output, so a typical use might be
this:

  mksimtape file1 file2 file3 > tape.out

Each 'file' on the tape is written with a block size of 10240 bytes,
unless otherwise specified. To use a particular block size for a file,
append it to the end of the filename, separated by a colon, viz.:

  mksimtape file1:512 file2 file3 > tape.out

This would write 'file1' with a block size of 512 bytes; 'file2' and
'file3' would still be written with a block size of 10240 bytes.
